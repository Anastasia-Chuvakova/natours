/* BEST PRACTISE IS TO SET ROOT TO %. SO take 10px(which we use here)
 and devide by 16px(common root size)
the result will be in %, which is 62.5%. Use it!!!
For the rest, use REM, and it is easy to calculate.
The formula is Xpx(10px because we use it as a root, 
only it is declared in % in the root) devide by Xpx(from any other property) 
will be equal to amount in REM;
